An emulator of the fictional TIS-100 computer from the Zachtronics game: http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/
All mistakes and poor ideas my own; all good ideas borrowed from @munificent's Crafting Interpreters: http://craftinginterpreters.com/
This is my first real C project. Constructive criticism welcome; unconstructive criticism accepted.
